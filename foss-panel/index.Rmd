+ "for free" (*gratis*) and 

+ "with little or no restriction" (*libre*).

1. .emphasis[RUN]<br>Run the program as you wish, for any purpose.

1. .emphasis[STUDY]<br>Study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

--

1. .emphasis[COPY & DISTRIBUTE]<br>Redistribute copies so you can help others.

--

1. .emphasis[CHANGE & IMPROVE]<br>Distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
