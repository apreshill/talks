We don't use tools inherently because the tool is fun to use, although that is nice side effect when it happens. And when we have a choice of tools, that matters. 

But like the chimpanzee, we mainly want to get a job done.

what is the difference?

You may be thinking of yourself more as a tool-user

But today I want you to think about yourself as the tool-maker

Is it kind? What makes a tool kind?

Hot vs cool contexts

https://idlab.ucmerced.edu/sites/idlab.ucmerced.edu/files/page/documents/walle_lopez_castillo_in_press.pdf

Contrary to cool tasks, hot EF tasks require regulation in contexts where the outcomes are of greater personal significance, such as completing a task to earn a desirable prize(e.g., Hongwanishkul et al., 2005; Kerr & Zelazo, 2004).
