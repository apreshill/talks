We don't use tools inherently because the tool is fun to use, although that is nice side effect when it happens. And when we have a choice of tools, that matters. 

But like the chimpanzee, we mainly want to get a job done.

> I can understand exactly what's being checked, I'm able to follow along with what's going on behind the scenes with each step, and I understand what I need to do next. What a difference! These messages are so much more helpful and clear -- I am so impressed!
